                                      TGETENT FUNCTION
TGETENT FUNCTION: The `tgetent` function loads terminal capabilities for a specific terminal type into a buffer.

FEATURES:
- Retrieves the terminal capabilities for a given terminal type (e.g., `xterm`, `vt100`) from the terminal description database (like `/etc/termcap` or `/usr/share/terminfo`).
- It is essential for programs that need to interact with terminals, allowing them to query terminal capabilities.
- Stores the information in a buffer for subsequent terminal control functions.

FUNCTION PROTOTYPE:
    int tgetent(char *bp, const char *name);

HOW IT WORKS:
    STEP                        DESCRIPTION
    ------------------------    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Call tgetent()              The function loads the terminal capabilities for the terminal type `name` into the buffer `bp`.
    Return value                Returns 1 if the entry was successfully found, 0 if not found, or -1 on error.

USAGE SCENARIOS:
- Used in terminal-based programs, especially those that need to query and manipulate terminal settings, like text editors or terminal-based games.
- A crucial part of working with terminal control libraries like `ncurses` or `termcap`.

COMPILATION:
Requires linking with the `termcap` or `ncurses` library.
